## Why?
Tired of lame, sad forms? Annoyed with tedious form builders? Limited in what kinds of custom validations and logic? You're in luck: [text is the universal interface](https://scale.com/blog/text-universal-interface), and TalkForm.AI is here to help.

Simply chat to create a form, and chat to fill it. The field types are inferred automatically by our AI, and all your form responses remain structured according to the inferred schema for easy analysis. And you get unlimited power to do custom validations and complicated logic.

Anything you can dream, you can build. Truly, we are in a golden age of technology.
